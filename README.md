### Projects
This tab will be used to...
  - `GSMB - Main`
    - Keep track of our sprints
    - Act as a to-do list
      - Can add new issues to the to-do lists
  - Create smaller scale projects or "subprojects"
    - When we break into smaller groups, this could be used by each group to keep track of their progress
