This shall serve as a base for everything regarding our CSI-2999 project.


The **ISSUES** tab will be used for things like...
- New ideas
- Bugs that need fixing
- Necessary features that need to be implemented
- Questions
- Help with code

This will **NOT** be where code or actual project materials will be placed.
Please put that in the code tab. Please also communicate through other means, like text or Discord, as this may not get checked often.
