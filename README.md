  - **IMPORTANT** When creating a new issue, look for "Projects" on the right. If necessary, add that issue to `GSMB - main`, it will auto-add it to the to-do list.

The **PROJECTS** tab will...
  - `GSMB - Main`
    - Keep track of our sprints
    - Act as a to-do list
      - Can add new issues to the to-do lists
  - Used to create smaller scale projects or "subprojects"
    - When we break into smaller groups, this could be used by each group to keep track of their progress
